## 💰 Platform Fee Logic

- **Rate**: 2% of seller's total monthly earnings
- **Calculation**: Sum of all `OrderItem.price × quantity` for seller's products in that month
- **Due date**: 5th of the following month
- **Payment**: Seller pays via UPI to `hritikguptak@paytm` and submits UTR
- **Admin actions**: Confirm (verified) / Reject UTR (seller resubmits) / Waive (forgive fee)
- **Overdue**: Auto-flagged after 5th if still PENDING — admin sees warning flag

---

## 👤 Roles Explained

| Role | How to get it | Access |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `BUYER` | Default on register | Browse + buy products |
| `SELLER` | Select on register | List + manage own products |
| `ADMIN` | Manually set in Neon DB | Full platform control |

**To make yourself Admin:**
1. Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) → your project → **Tables**
2. Find `User` table → find your user → change `role` to `ADMIN`
3. Sign out and sign back in
